# carousel
An image carousel using pure JavaScript.

This can be used for any website header to give the page a more oomph.
Don't forget to use aria-labels for the buttons to optimize the page for those that use screen readers.
Screen readers will have difficult time reading < > buttons.

Also, to the first "carousel-item" also add in class called "carousel-item-visible" 
the reason for this is because you will want to eventually hide all carousel items, but you always want to show the first one on loading the page
Thanks to unsplash for the images
